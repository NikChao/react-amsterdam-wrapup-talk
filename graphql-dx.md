# Graphql
### @peggyrrayzis

GraphQL is about DX
- Tools shouldn't get in the way
- graphql helps with the data layer
- she made people swear an oath not to put UI state into cache

demo: github.com/peggyrayzis/redux-to-graphql

- works well with TS
- apollo CLI autogens types from schema
- can manage localstate
- future apollo will give smart suggestions i.e. for perf.
