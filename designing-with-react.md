# Designing with React
### Mark from seek Melbourne

Components let us build our own DSL
- Polaris (Shopify)
- Lightning (Salesforce)
- Carbon design system (IBM)
- Seek style guide

Feeding back into design
- React Sketch.app
- Write platform agnostic react
- HTML-sketch-app

Designing with components
- Framer X
- Modulz
- Interplay

What is a design tool
- Easy to set up
- New documents are cheap
- Iteration is really fast
- Work can be easily shared

Babel REPL/Code sandbox/etc. good ways to test code very quickly and get feedback

- Playroom <-- can start writing JSX immediately, cool as tool
- forces to use design language, API first
- can be installed as npm package, has config file, supports theming
- can extend it's webpack

```bash
npm install playroom
```

- seek is doing some cool stuff with consolidating it's many brands into one themeable/configurable design system
