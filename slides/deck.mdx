### 1. Design systems

---

### What is a design system?
- A Langauge
- A foundation, set of primitives, and set of patterns
- A way of Reducing choice in building blocks
 <!-- (typography, color, spacing) -->

---

### Cool takeaways
- We can use simplified react to bridge the gap between design/FE development

---

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems: 'center', width: '100%' }}>
  <img src="./braid.png" style={{ height: '75px', margin: '75px' }} />
  <img src="./playroom.png" style={{ height: '75px', margin: '75px' }} />
</div>

### 2. SSR


---

### What is SSR?

- Rendering the page on the server and sending a fully rendered page to the client
- Try it out with `Next.js`
<!-- Max Stoiber regrets not using Next.js for spectrum -->



---

### Cool takeaways

- Becoming trememdously popular


- Can be a HUGE performance win
  - Companies (like Netflix) using SSR for huge performance wins
   <!-- getting +50% perceived perf by removing all client side react -->



- https://nextjs.org
- https://github.com/esxjs/esx

### 3. Micro frontends

---

### What are micro-frontends
- Solving the problem of colaborating on large frontends


- **Spotify:** Many iframes rendered on the page which communicate with an in-house event bus
<!-- although they're moving to a react-redux solution so we'll see what they do with that  -->
- **SkyScanner/OpenTable:** https://opencomponents.github.io/

---

### Cool takeaways ft. DAZN

- 1 micro frontend loaded at a time
- no shared dependencies between micro frontends
- 1 micro frontend per business domain


- Request flow
    - Bootstraper loads first
    - retrieves some config from the API
    - resolves micro-frontend based on request/url/whatever
    - mounts the micro-frontend with config

### Workshop
- serving graph-ql is a piece of cake
  - prisma/graphql-yoga
  - graphpack


- consuming graqh-ql is a piece of cake too
  - react-apollo-boost
  - react-apollo-hooks

### Conference talk by Apollo

- 2019 will be about DX for apollo
- better TS support (apollo-cli can already auto-gen TS based on GQL schema)
- better suggestions (i.e. for query perf)
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="apollo.png" style={{ marginTop: '100px', height: '200px', width: 'auto' }} />

### Fundamentals

---

- You should understand your abstractions

https://github.com/kentcdodds/requisite-react


- How to write better react

https://sid.studoi/refactoring

<!-- - components should take props which handle behaviour not interaction
- components should do as little as possible and do it well, delegate up if you can
- if some logic isn't core to a feature, put it in a HOC or hook -->

<!-- - When designing an app which is mobile first/web for support, max stoiber says use react-native-web -->
