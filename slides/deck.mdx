### Design systems

- Reducing choice in building blocks (typography, color, spacing)
- We can use simplified react to bridge the gap between design/FE development

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="./braid.png" style={{ height: '75px' }} />
  <img src="./playroom.png" style={{ height: '75px' }} />
</div>

### SSR
- Seems to be becoming more popular, especially `Next.js`
- Max stoiber talked up Next.js, regrets not using it as their SSR solution at spectrum
- Perf talk about netflix getting +50% perceived perf (halved TTI) by removing all client side react
- esxjs which is an optimisation over Next js

### Micro frontends
- DAZN talked about how they break FE work across many teams
- Spotify way: Many iframes rendered on the page which communicate with an in-house event bus (although, spotify is moving to a react/redux solution so idk if they still considewr this a good idea)
- DAZN way
  - 1 micro frontend loaded at a time, don't want to share dependencies between micro frontends
  - 1 micro frontend per business domain (DDD)
  - Bootstraper loads first, retrieves some config from the API, based on request/url/whatever selects the correct micro frontend

### GraphQL
1. Workshop
    - serving graph-ql is actually a piece of cake with the right tools (yoga, graphpack)
    - react-apollo-hooks is very good, but not official, therefore requires a different context provider to react-apollo(-boost)

2. Conf talk
    - 2019 will be about DX for apollo
    - better TS support (apollo-cli can already auto-gen TS based on GQL schema)
    - better suggestions (i.e. for query perf)

### Fundamentals/React/Misc
- babel repl is good for figuring out exactly what's going on

- components should take props which handle behaviour not interaction
- components should do as little as possible and do it well, delegate up if you can
- if some logic isn't core to a feature, put it in a HOC or hook

- When designing an app which is mobile first/web for support, max stoiber says use react-native-web
