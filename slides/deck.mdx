### Design systems

---

- Reducing choice in building blocks (typography, color, spacing)
- We can use simplified react to bridge the gap between design/FE development

- https://component-driven.github.io/component-driven-development/styleguide

- https://airbnb.design/painting-with-code/

- https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system
- https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom


<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="./braid.png" style={{ height: '75px' }} />
  <img src="./playroom.png" style={{ height: '75px' }} />
</div>

### SSR

---

- Becoming more popular, especially `Next.js`
<!-- Max Stoiber regrets not using Next.js for spectrum -->

- Performance
  - netflix getting +50% perceived perf by removing all client side react
  - esxjs which is an optimisation over Next js

- ðŸ†• https://nextjs.org

### Micro frontends

---

- Solving the problem of colaborating on large frontends
- Spotify way: Many iframes rendered on the page which communicate with an in-house event bus
<!-- although they're moving to a react-redux solution so we'll see what they do with that  -->
- SkyScanner/OpenTable use https://opencomponents.github.io/
- DAZN talked about how they break FE work across many teams

---

### DAZN way
- 1 micro frontend loaded at a time
- no shared dependencies between micro frontends
- 1 micro frontend per business domain (DDD)
- Request flow
    - Bootstraper loads first
    - retrieves some config from the API
    - resolves micro-frontend based on request/url/whatever
    - mounts the micro-frontend with config

### GraphQL

---

### Workshop
- serving graph-ql is actually a piece of cake with the right tools (yoga, graphpack)
- react-apollo-hooks is very good, but not official, therefore requires a different context provider to react-apollo(-boost)


---


### Conf talk
- 2019 will be about DX for apollo
- better TS support (apollo-cli can already auto-gen TS based on GQL schema)
- better suggestions (i.e. for query perf)

---

### Fundamentals/React/Misc

---

- babel repl is good for figuring out exactly what's going on

- components should take props which handle behaviour not interaction
- components should do as little as possible and do it well, delegate up if you can
- if some logic isn't core to a feature, put it in a HOC or hook

- When designing an app which is mobile first/web for support, max stoiber says use react-native-web
