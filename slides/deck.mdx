### What did people talk about?

---

### 1. Design systems

---


- Reducing choice in building blocks (typography, color, spacing)
- We can use simplified react to bridge the gap between design/FE development

<p style={{ padding: '80px' }} />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="./braid.png" style={{ height: '75px' }} />
  <img src="./playroom.png" style={{ height: '75px' }} />
</div>

### 2. SSR


---

- Becoming more popular, especially `Next.js`
<!-- Max Stoiber regrets not using Next.js for spectrum -->


- Can be a performance win
  - Companies (like Netflix) using SSR for performance
   <!-- getting +50% perceived perf by removing all client side react -->
  - esxjs which is an optimisation over Next js



- https://nextjs.org



---

### 3. Micro frontends

---

- Solving the problem of colaborating on large frontends

- **Spotify way:** Many iframes rendered on the page which communicate with an in-house event bus
<!-- although they're moving to a react-redux solution so we'll see what they do with that  -->
- **SkyScanner/OpenTable:** https://opencomponents.github.io/

### Micro-frontends continued: DAZN

- 1 micro frontend loaded at a time
- no shared dependencies between micro frontends
- 1 micro frontend per business domain


- Request flow
    - Bootstraper loads first
    - retrieves some config from the API
    - resolves micro-frontend based on request/url/whatever
    - mounts the micro-frontend with config

### Workshop
- serving graph-ql is a piece of cake
  - prisma/graphql-yoga
  - graphpack


- consuming graqh-ql is a piece of cake too
  - react-apollo-boost
  - react-apollo-hooks

### Conference talk by Apollo

- 2019 will be about DX for apollo
- better TS support (apollo-cli can already auto-gen TS based on GQL schema)
- better suggestions (i.e. for query perf)
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="apollo.png" style={{ marginTop: '100px', height: '200px', width: 'auto' }} />

### Fundamentals/React/Misc

---

- You should understand your abstractions

https://github.com/kentcdodds/requisite-react


- How to write better react

https://sid.studoi/refactoring

<!-- - components should take props which handle behaviour not interaction
- components should do as little as possible and do it well, delegate up if you can
- if some logic isn't core to a feature, put it in a HOC or hook -->

<!-- - When designing an app which is mobile first/web for support, max stoiber says use react-native-web -->
